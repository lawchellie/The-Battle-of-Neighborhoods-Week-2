This final project explores the best locations for African restaurants throughout the city of New York. Potentially the owner of the new African restaurant can have great prospect of making profit on a consistent basis. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will a success or a failure. Therefore, our project will attempt to answer the questions - Where should an investor open an African Restaurant and where should he go if he wants great African dish.
